# Inside of Delorean (Interface)

# Create a UI with a Sci twist
The aim of this assignment was to design and implement a UI with a Sci-fi element using the principles of Object Oriented Programming.

# De Lorean 
For this assignment, I choose to design the inside De Lorean out of the film Back to future.

# Details of Usability 

* A user can click various numbers (buttons) on the (Input Dial) to select the date they wish to go “Back to the Future” too. When a user clicks the button, it makes a button sound. 
* When the date is set it is then displayed on the screen on the Time Dial. If the user clicks the “Activate” button the shooting star meme song will start to play and iconic images for each year will sequentially appear on the screen up until that date.

# Most Proud of:
I am most proud of getting the input dial and the time dial to interact with each other. Then being able to press activate to start off the sequential flow of images.
